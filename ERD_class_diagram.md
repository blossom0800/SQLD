# ERD to class diagram
```
A class diagram is a UML type static structure diagram that describes the structure of a system by showing the system’s classes, their attributes and relationships among objects while ERD is a visual representation of data based on the ER model that describes how entities are related to each other in the database. Thus, this is the main difference between Class Diagram and Entity Relationship Diagram.
